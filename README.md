# ER Example Tourney/FC Overlay

Proof of concept for tourney/fc overlays. To actually use this in multiplayer, use the [Seamless Coop Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510) and enable pvp mode.

Requires Node 16+ and the [Elden Ring Cheat Table by The Grand Archives](https://github.com/inunorii/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA).

```
bash install # install dependencies
bash compile # compile client
bash start # start server
```

then add `http://localhost:4567` as browser source in OBS.
